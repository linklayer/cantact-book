# SocketCAN

SocketCAN is a collection of CAN drivers and networking tools for Linux. It allows interfacing with CAN bus devices in a similar fashion as other network devices. This allows for developers to write code that can support a variety of CAN bus interfaces, including CANtact. 

Unfortunately, SocketCAN only works on Linux.
