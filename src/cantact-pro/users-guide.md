After updating, the device will work on Linux via SocketCAN. For details, see [SocketCAN](../tools/socketcan.html). 

On all platforms, you can install the CANtact CLI. For details, see [CANtact CLI](../tools/cantact-cli.html).

For more information on software support, see [Software Tools](../tools/software-tools.html).

## Pin Assignments

|Pin | Function | CAN 0 Only? |
|----|----------|-------------|
|1   |          |
|2   | CAN -    |
|3   | GND      |
|4   | SWCAN    | Yes
|5   |          |
|6   | GND      |
|7   | CAN +    |
|8   |          |
|9   | +12 V In | Yes

Note that single-wire CAN is only available on the CAN 0 connector.

## LED Indicators

The device has four LEDs, two for each CAN channel. When powered on, the LEDs will blink in sequence. The LED indications during normal operations are shown here.

|Color  | State   | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Green | Solid   | channel enabled, no activity
| Green | Blinking| receive activity 
| Red   | Solid   | channel transmit enabled, no activity
| Red   | Blinking| transmit activity 

When using SocketCAN, each CAN interface can be identified by blinking the corresponding LEDs using `ethtool`. This is especially useful when using multiple devices.

```
sudo ethtool --identify can0
```

## Configuring Permissions on Linux

By default, root privileges are required to interact with the device. To allow other users to access the device, 
create a file at `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-cantact.rules`:
```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6070", MODE="0666"
```

After creating the file, reload the udev rules:
```
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

This will make the device accessible to all users. 

## Flashing Firmware

1. Download the newest firmware binary [from Github](https://github.com/linklayer/cantact-pro-fw/releases).
2. To enter bootloader mode, hold down the button beside the USB connector while connecting the device
to your computer.
